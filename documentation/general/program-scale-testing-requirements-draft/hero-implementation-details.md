# Hero test from theory to practice

## Introduction

Hero test is a syntetic test ment to stress the device under the worst case scenario. Reality is that worst case for device A is not necesary worst case for device B also any vendor desire is not to showcase only the worst case but they want also to showcase the best case. Knowing both the best and worst case is valuable because in production the expected performance will be somwhere between best and worst case case, knowing the lower and upperl limit will provide a good understanding of the device performance.

This is why the implemenentation of hero test is actualy a colection of tests that colect multiple metrics.
